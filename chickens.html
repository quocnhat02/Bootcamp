    The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species,
    with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon
    junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is
    a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel.
    A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a
    hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
