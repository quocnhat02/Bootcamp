      The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl
      species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon
      junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock
      is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a
      cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird
      is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.

      Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens
      were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries
      BC).[2][3] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food
      (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

    <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>
    <p>
      Chickens are omnivores.[28] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to
      search for seeds, insects, and even animals as large as lizards, small
      snakes,[29] or sometimes young mice.[30]
